# ASL-Detection-using-CNN
The project is about Sign Language Recognition with Convolution Neural Network where images are passed as input and the corresponding class(Alphabet) is detected by the model.

##### Dataset is availble on Kaggle as ASL Alphabets 
link:https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet

Complete_Code_Training.ipynb file is used to train the model using a the dataset and also consits the analysis of the results with different evaluation metrics.
The trained model is saved for future use 
<br />
<br />
We have used Canny Pre-Processing for the images which can be ingored if required
<br />
<br />
Prediction_Using_Camera.py is the code used to run the saved model where the Computer Camera is used to capture realtime video and display the corresponding letters next to it using the model.
<br />
<br />
Models folder has some trained models which can be used.
